As a content editor / manager, you'll want to enable Percolate Integration and
Percolate Integration Import. Then, enter your API key at
admin/config/content/percolate. Map your site's users to their Percolate user
accounts at admin/config/content/percolate/users. You can find your API key and
user ID at https://percolate.com/settings/publishing. Now you're good to import,
just navigate to admin/content/percolate and fill in the import form. You can
set the form to auto-import at admin/config/content/percolate/import.

As a developer, you'll only need the pi module, pi_import is optional. This'll
give you access to the Percolate API by calling the pi_build_api function. You
can see what's available in phpercolate/Api.php.
